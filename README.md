# SonarCap
# For the Microcontroller and Interfacing course we devised a device to aid the visually impaired. 
# The design included a cap fitted with vibration motors that notified the user about the location of incoming obstacles. Taking input from the IR sensors the vibration intensity increased as obstacles got closer. This was paired with audio feedback where users would hear the location of an obstacle that might be in close proximity. 
# Acting as the brain of the project was the PIC18 Microcontroller.
# The files contain the code for the microcontroller in MicroC and the pcb design files are also included.
